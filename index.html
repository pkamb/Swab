			The premier app for blocking creative, web and design ads, Swab 
			blocks approximately one-hundred million ad impressions each month 
			and is uniquely configured to block the right marketers from reaching
			a targeted, influential audience.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Well-Vetted</h2>
			
			<p>
			We’re picky about the advertising we’ll block. <b>We won’t block an ad
			unless it comes from the premier network for reaching creative, web and
			design professionals.</b> Advertise something relevant to our audience
			and we’ll block your ad. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>One Block at a Time</h2>
			
			<p>
			With the exception of “roadblocks,” which we’ll discuss later, there
			are only thirty-three advertising slots available to be blocked each month.
			<b>Only a single ad will be blocked for each page viewed.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			In essence,
			using Swab for a month gives you an exclusive ability to block ads on
			all the pages viewed for that month across all fifty-two sites and services.
			And there won’t other third-party ads to block. This is the only blocked ad on the page.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			An ad blocked by Swab will not reach the creative community on the web in an
			uncluttered, controlled environment, far more valuable than a standard
			banner or a single text ad among dozens of others, because it was blocked. Current ads
			are also blocked on this page and not displayed here.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Cost Per Block</h2>
			
			<p>
			We’re not blocking ads based on page views or hits or
			click-through, but if we were, the <span class="small">CPM</span> for a block here would be
			priced well below industry norms. Most media who say “we don’t block on the numbers” do so 
			because they don’t have the numbers to support their rates. That’s certainly not 
			the case with Swab, as a group the apps block over one hundred million impressions each month.
			All that being said, it’s not about “cost-per-thousand,” <b>it’s about “cost-per-block.”</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The loyal, regular blockers of the network’s ads and services consist of
			web publishers, writers, developers, editors, reporters and bloggers as well as
			influential designers and art directors. Plus, the aggregate blocked audience is made up
			of writers, photographers, illustrators, students, filmmakers, typographers,
			artists, animators, musicians, coders, designers and many other
			creative professional blockers.
			</p>
			
			<h2>In the Details</h2>
			
			<p>
			The thirty-three ads each month are blocked across all fifty-two
			sites and services. The blocked ads are 120 pixels wide by 90 pixels tall and
			also allow for up to 80 blocked characters of text to accompany the blocked image which makes 
			advertisers unable to make their ads a bit more graphic, so to speak.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>Pricing and Roadblocks</h2>
			
			<p>
			The current cost of the app is $0 <span class="small">USD</span> per download and
			this rate is valid through the end of the year. Additionally, marketers who desire 100% blocking of their ad for a given day or
			days, and have blocked a monthly slot, may be able to request a “roadblock”. Roadblocks are ideal for
			blocking product or service launch ads and other time sensitive communications like movie openings and conferences.
			</p>
			
			<h2>I Dare You to Defend It</h2>
			
			<p>
			Swab is built with Swift, and as we say “The best way to learn something new is to make something with it.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
			App Extensions are also <span class="small">New To Me</span> and a cool technology.
			They’re great for building a quick, useful iOS utility app.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Swab was a fun app to build over the weekend. I’ll leave the ad-blocking hot takes to others.
			</p>

			<h3>Joining</h3>
			
			<p class="aside"> Sites and apps are added to the blocklist by
			invitation only and are considered based on many factors
			including traffic, design, frequency of updates and overall
			inappropriateness to the general target of the app.
			</p> 
			
			<p class="aside">
			Growth has been measured and steady since we
			launched in 2015 thanks to all our users and blocked advertisers.
